The below `SplunkOtelAgent` custom resource contains all the specification that can be configured. 

```yaml
apiVersion: o11y.splunk.com/v1alpha1
kind: SplunkOtelAgent
metadata:

spec:

  // +required SplunkRealm is the Splunk APM Realm your Splukn account
  // exists in. For example, us0, us1, etc.
  realm: <YOUR_SPLUNK_REALM> 

  // +required ClusterName is the name of the Kubernetes cluster. This
  will be used to identify this cluster in Splunk dashboards.
